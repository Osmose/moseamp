/*
 * When this file is linked to a DLL, it sets up a delay-load hook that
 * intervenes when the DLL is trying to load the host executable
 * dynamically. Instead of trying to locate the .exe file it'll just
 * return a handle to the process image.
 *
 * This allows compiled addons to work when the host executable is renamed.
